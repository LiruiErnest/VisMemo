					1. Examine the file and find out the top level expenditure categories based on indentation. What are the top level spending categories?
				</p>
				<p>
					There are 14 top level spending categories in this dataset, the name and attribute of these categories are shown as follows.
				</p>
				<div class="flat-table" id = "p1table">
					
				</div>
				<br>
				
			</div>

			<hr>

			<div id="p2">
				<p>
					2. For each of the top level expenditure categories, calculate the total expenditure and then the percentage of expenditure from each of the five income groups.
				</p>
				<p>
					The total expenditure and the percentage of expenditure from each of the five income groups are shown as follows:
				</p>

				<div class="flat-table" id = "p2table">
					
				</div>

				<br>

					3. Using D3 to re-produce a visualization similar to what we discuss in class, as shown below, but you do not need to expand the slice that has the largest portion as in the picture. Just regular pie chart will do.
				</p>
				<div id="p3image">

			<div id="p4">
				<p>
					4. Based on the after tax income, calculate the percentage for each of the five income group. Create a pie chart that show the income percentages using D3.
				</p>
				<p>
					The percentage for each of the five income and their after tax income are shown as follows:
				</p>

				<div class="flat-table" id = "p4table">
					
				</div>

					5. Generate a visualization similar to what we discuss in class using D3.
				</p>

				<p>
					I utilize the after tax income in the previous question as the income of each group, and compute the percentage of 14 top categories in five income group, the result is as follows:
				</p>

				<div class="flat-table" id="p5table">
					
				</div>

				<div id="p5image">
					
					
				</div>
			</div>

			<hr>

			<div id = "p6">

				<p>
					6. For each of the five income groups, draw a barchart to track the top 50 expenditures. Allow mouse over the bars to show the name of the spending items.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to find all lowest level expenditures, I write a python script and filter all categories with a high indentation, the script can be found in the data repository. The result is shown as follows:
				</p>
				<div class = "table-scroll">
					<div class="flat-table" id="p6table">
					
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<hr>

				<div id="p6image">
