# VisMemo
This study will investigate whether feature sequence, i.e. the order we choose to present a set of features, will affect memorability of these visualization techniques. Experiment being conducted by presenting a set of visualization images with a specific order, with some images repeated twice in this sequence. We characterize the memorability by measuring the possibility of participants to detect repeated images. We then determine if feature memorability is related to the specific order such that we could use order to augment training effectiveness. The research will help us gain a solid understanding of visualization feature space and their relationship with their visual memorability. Furthermore, we will be able to design more effective interactive visualization tools to help guide visualization design to augment human learning experience.
